These scripts were created to aid in research of the environments of supercells as they cross the Appalchain Mountains. The code was used to gather RAP and RUC Data to calculate kinematic and thermodynamic parameters of inflow points of the supercells. All of thse files are in Jupyter Notebook using Python. I used this research project for my grad school thesis at UNC Charlotte 2021.
